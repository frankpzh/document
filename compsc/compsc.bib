    abstract = {{This paper describes a novel approach to providingmodular and extensible operating system functionality and encapsulated environments based on a synthesis of microkernel and virtual machine concepts. We have developed a software-based virtualizable architecture called Fluke that allows recursive virtual machines (virtual machines running on other virtual machines) to be implemented efficiently by a microkernel running on generic hardware. A complete virtual machine interface is provided at each level; efficiency derives from needing to implement only new functionality at each level. This infrastructure allows common OS functionality, such as process management, demand paging, fault tolerance, and debugging support, to be provided by cleanly modularized, independent, stackable virtual machine monitors, implemented as user processes. It can also provide uncommon or unique OS features, including the above features specialized for particular applications \&\#039; needs, virtual machines transparently distributed cross-node, or security monitors that allow arbitrary untrusted binaries to be executed safely. Our prototype implementation of this model indicates that it is practical to modularize operating systems this way. Some types of virtual machine layers impose almost no overhead at all, while others impose some overhead (typically 0--35\%), but only on certain classes of applications.}},

    abstract = {{(from executive summary) Cloud Computing, the long-held dream of computing as a utility, has the potential to transform a large part of the
IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and
purchased. Developers with innovative ideas for new Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays
in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about overprovisioning
for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or underprovisioning
for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies
with large batch-oriented tasks can get results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one
hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for
large scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT.}},
