* Xen and the Art of Virtulization
  mailto:ian.pratt@xen.org
** Overview
   - support new cpu, chipset, smart io
   - os para-virtulization
	 win, redhat, novell, sun
** Why Virtulization
   - reduce mess by multi-app
	 security hole on some app, won't explode to others
	 xen: one app per x86 server
   - server consolidation
	 typical cpu utilization: 5~15%
   - easy to manage
   - avoid vm relocation
	 xen: dynamically re-balance workload
** Virtulization security
   - Bad: attack will exploit
   - Good: Xen is smaller, more defensible than a OS
   - Firwall/IDS/malware scanner more robust
   - hardening OS with memory control(root-kit)
** Network interface
   VM0: backend with native device, VMn: frontend device
** IOMMU
   - Direct Device Assignment
   - Every os can be assigned to native device(s)
   - NIC presents itself as multiple PCI devices
** Falut tolerance
** Virtulization on Cell phone
   - 1 for radio
   - 1 for softwares
   - 1 for downloading things
** Xen Cloud Platform(XCP)

* Evolution of Distributed Operation Systems and Virtualization
  Boring...
** History
** Microkernel based
** Current generation and virtualization
** Next generation
* Virtualization Overview
** Layers of Virtualization
   - Instruction Set Architecture(ISA)
   - OS ABI
   - DLL ABI
   - High Level Language
** Virtual Machine Monitor(Hypervisor)
*** Essential characteristics
	- Equivalence
	- Isolation
	- Efficiency
	  Rule out simulator
*** Requirement
	- Protect self from guest
	- Isolate guest softwares
	- Present a platform interface
** Virtualizable ISA
   - Sensitive instruction
	 All about resource
	 + Control sensitive
	   Config resource
	 + Behavior sensitive
	   Depend on config
   - Privileged instrction
   - SI is a sub set of PI --> Virtualizable
** Approaches
   - OS-level virtualization
	 1 kernel-space with n user-space, container
   - Full virtualization
	 Hardware-assisted
	 Binary translation
   - Partial virtualization
	 Subset of all hardware features
   - Paravirtualization
	 Modify guest OS, Cooperative virtualization
** Hardware-assisted virtualization
   - Fix instruction hole
   - Simplfy vm code
   - Improve performance
*** Intel Virtualization Technology(VT)
**** Virtual Machine Extensions(VMX)
***** VMX root operation
	  - ring 0-3
	  - fully privileged
***** VMX non-root operation
	  - ring 0-3
	  - not fully privileged
	  - entered by vmm
**** VM entry
	 - VMLAUNCH
	 - VMRESUME
**** VM exit
	 - external events
	 - exceptions
	 - some instructions
*** Enlighten OS for virtualization
** Memory virtualization
*** Challenges
	- OS expect memory start from 0
	- OS expect memory contiguous
*** Page frame allocation
	- Partitioning
	- Contents based sharing
	- Ballooning
	  Balloon driver on Guest OS, steal memory from Guest to Hypervisor
	- Host swapping
*** MMU Virtualization
	- Direct page table
	- Vitrual TLB
	- Shadow page table
	- Extended page table
	  Another level of page table
** I/O Virtualization
*** Direct assignment
*** Single Root I/O Virtualization(SR-IOV)
	1 NIC --> 1 PF + n VF
*** Virtual Machine Device Queue(VMDq)
	- Software switch
	- Hardware switch

   Extending Xen with Intel Virtualization Technology

* CPU Virtualization
  Boring...
* I/O Virtualization
** Software Emulation
*** Catch
**** VMCS I/O bitmap
	 which IO port access will cause VM Exit
**** VMM shadow page table/EPT table
	 trap MMIO access
*** DMA Emulation
*** Interrupt Emulation
	Virtual PIC -> Virtual CPU
	VM Entry Interrupt Injection
	interrupt when VM Entry calls
*** PIC Discovery/Configuration
	- PCI device: (BUS, Device, Function)
	- Software enumerate device through configuration space
	- IO port/MMIO address is configurable
** Para-virtualization
   - Improve I/O performance
   - VMM presents a virtual device
	 Frond-end/Back-end Driver
   - Optimization
	 Batched I/O
	 Shared memory
** Direct I/O
   Assign physical device to a VM directly
*** DMA Operation
	Memory mismatch due to memory layout mismatch
*** DMA Remapping, implemented by VT-d
	Device assignment structure
** SR-IOV
*** Virtulization friendly device
	- Device can shared by VMs
	- Start with one Physical Function(PF)
	- Replicate resources by Virtual Function(VF)

** 1.0 consolidation
*** Consolidate multiple servers into fewer with virtualization
**** Reduce CapEx OpEx and energy
**** Chances
***** Server may have low resource usage
***** may tie to different resource types
***** may hav interleaved peak usage
**** DONE 一个机器跑一个应用，才能保证性能

***** Syscall更薄，而已
***** 未来可能会做到真实的Isolation
*** Performance factors
**** Exclusive res ctrl vs Time0shared res ctrl
**** Software emulation overhead
	 trap-and-emulate
	 - faster hardware
	 - proactive enlightment from VM
	 - Dedicated resources
**** Insufficient resource
**** Cross-Vm interfrence
***** Resource contention
***** Internal state pollution(cache, TLB)
**** VMM inefficiency
**** Distorted premise
***** Cirtical section preempted by VMM
** 2.0 flexible management
*** VM mobility
**** Live migration
	 1. Starts when VM is hosting service
		Copy whole memory
	 2. Live migrate dirty pages
		Iterative and convergent
	 3. Stop VM on host-A
		Rest dirty pages
		Virtual device/CPU state
	 4. Resume VM on host-B
**** Key concerns
	 - Service shutdown duration
	 - Total migration duration
**** Challenges
	 - Memory-intensive workload
	 - Policy to trigger migration
	 - Hardware I/O acceleration(Direct I/O, SR-IOV)
*** Resource metering
*** Energy efficiency
*** High availability
**** Ensure service continuity
**** Reliability, Availability, Servablilty(RAS)
	 - Alert and fix hardware failure
	 - Reduce failover frequency
**** Software HA
	 - Restart VM on server if VM itself fails
	 - Virtual lockstep
	   Primary VM and Backup VM
	   Running same things
	   Synchronize events
	 - Fast check-pointing
** 3.0 enterprise cloud
*** SaaS PaaS DaaS IaaS WebHosting ITaaS Utility
*** Challenges
**** QoS/SLA(Service level agreement)
	 - Translate SLA into resource budget
	 - Ensure agreed level of quality
**** Security/Trust
	 - Competitors may be hosted on same node
	 - Fully virtulized environment
	   Low entrophy
**** Inter-operability
**** Virtual infrastructure similarity
