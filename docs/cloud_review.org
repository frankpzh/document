We ask that you focus on the relevance, completeness and accuracy of
the content, not on correcting grammar errors and typos. What you see
is a raw manuscript which has not been designed, copyedited or
typeset. Code annotations as they appear in the manuscript are in an
intermediate format that will be turned into the usual Manning
number-in-a-dot format during book production.

* COMMON QUESTIONS
** First, please tell us a little about yourself. 
   - Q: What do you do and what is your technical background?

   - A: I'm a graduated student in Tsinghua University. Virtualization
     is my major, and I have one year experience on hacking Xen.

   - Q: On a scale of 1-10, how would you categorize your expertise in
     this technology?  (1=none, 10=expert)

   - A: I would say 3 or 4.

   - Q: Did you read the entire manuscript?  If not, which chapters did
     you read?

   - A: I only got 4 chapters, and I read them all.

** Imagine that you're writing a review for this book on Amazon...
   - Q: How many stars would you give it?

   - A: It depends on the remaining. Right now I would give 4.

   - Q: What would you say? 

   - A: This book has a deep introduction to the hottest technique
     right now in the world. The author trys to teach readers using
     open-source softwares to solve problems in real IT companies. He
     definitely did it well. Compare to other "In Action" books,
     readers of this book need extra cost on action, the charge of
     several services. It's not the author's fault, but it really lets
     some readers go away.

   - Q: What would the authors need to change to get 5 stars?

   - A: I'm not sure right now.

** Weâ€™d like to know what you think of the writing.
   - Q: Is the writing interesting? Does the content hold your
   attention?

   - A: Outstanding. It will be perfect if the ch1 have real world
     examples other than the source code management one. BTW, the ?aaS
     are not well-explained, you may need more words on them.

   - Q: Is the ToC well organized? What would you change?

   - A: One question: What's the meaning of ch2's name? I cannot figure
     out any relevance to its content.

   - Q: Is the book too long/short? Is there anything you'd add or cut?

   - A: The first 4 chapter is good. But I think ch2 needs structure
     change.

   - Q: Does the book make learning the subject easy?

   - A: Absolutely. No one will teach you how to install/configure
     open source packages, and which tool should you use when you meet
     performance problems. One thing needs to be awared: Readers can
     use different linux distributions, and installing packages on
     them differs. Simply using "./configure & & make & & make
     install" may cause potential problems on some distribution.

   - Q: Is the technical content good for learning and valuable in practice?

   - A: Sure, especially in ch4.

   - Q: Does the book present anything different compared to what is
     available on the web and in other books? What?

   - A: This is the first time I see a detailed introduction to cloud
     computing.

   - Q: Did you have any "aha!" moments while reading this manuscript?

   - A: Yes. On the page-speed test in ch4. That's impressive.

** Source code examples are really important for learning.
   - Q: Did you run the source code examples?

   - A: Not yet

   - Q: Did you find the examples well chosen to help learn the material?

   - A: I only see part of code.

   - Q: Does the code reflect best practices?

   - A:

   - Q: Are the examples reusable?

   - A:

   - Q: Is it accessible to beginners? Is it valuable for advanced developers?

   - A: It's hard for beginners, even to some advanced developers. For
     example, I've used python/django for web services before, but I
     need additional effort to understand ruby on rails code.

   - Q: Are the code examples nicely explained?

   - A: Yes. The code in ch2 is well-explained.

** What can you tell us about the market for this book?
   - Q: Is this a hot topic?

   - A: Yes.

   - Q: Do you know about any competing books? How does this book
     compare?

   - A: Haven't seen any.

   - Q: Based on what you've seen so far, how well do you think this
     book will sell?

   - A: I cannot tell.

   - Q: Is this a book you'd buy? Would you recommend it to others?

   - A: I'll buy it if I have a related job in the future.

** Wrap up.
   - Q: Please provide your snail mail address & permanent e-mail
     address.

   - A: frankpzh@gmail.com

   - Q: It is important for us to be aware of hot topics and good
     experts. Can you think of any?

   - A:

   - Q: Who impresses you in software development and other IT fields,
     and why?

   - A:

   - Q: Do you have any suggestions for articles based on sections from
     this book?

   - A:

* CUSTOM QUESTIONS
  - Q: Looking at the table of contents, can you offer some guidance
    as to which topic(s) the author should cover in greater depth at
    the expense of some other topic(s)? For that matter, do you think
    the topics listed are the most useful and interesting to include
    in an "In Action" book? If not, what topics would you like to see
    in the book?

  - A: The topics of ch4/5/6 should be taste and useful. They should
    be written in depth. I don't know much about tuning web
    services. In my view, the list of contents are comprehensive.

  - Q: Is the coverage of any topic too broad or shallow to be of use?

  - A: I'm not sure about "Avoiding lock-in". I think engineers don't
    consider it.

  - Q: The author uses a single example, his Reverso game, throughout
    the book to demonstrate how the cloud can meet web app
    requirements related to performance, scalability, big data
    storage, searching, analysis, and security among others. Do you
    think the Reverso example for the book is enough to stand in for
    most web apps or would you like to see other examples (suggestions
    would be appreciated)?

  - A: I'm eager to see how does it applied to the remaining chapters.

  - Q: Do the chapters you've reviewed have that hands-on feel that you
    expect to find in an "In Action" book?

  - A: Yes, especially on ch4. That's taste.

  - Q: Please list the strengths and weaknesses of this group of
    chapters. If you could recommend one change to improve the
    presentation, what would it be?

  - A: Pros: The author's understanding of cloud computing is
    awesome. Ch4 is taste. The code in ch2 is well-explained. Cons: I
    need a credit card to redo everything in the book. I don't know
    what is ch2 for. I must learn ruby to understand the code. Change
    recommended: Reconsidering ch2.

  - Q: Note that chapter 3 is incomplete. The chapter covers the open
    source packages used in the book, how to install and configure
    them, or how to automate system administration tasks. The author
    will complete in stages that coincide with future chapters. Are
    the instructions clear for the packages included so far? Do you
    have any comments or suggestions regarding the choice of packages?

  - A: I think a command prompt should be used in all instructions.
